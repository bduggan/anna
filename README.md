# Anna Karenina Rogue

Try to keep up with people in society

# Quick start

1. Install Perl 6 and zef
2. `zef install Terminal::Print`
3. `./anna`

# Notes

If there are too many characters and you can't keep up,
increase the maximum number threads:

```
RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS=200 ./anna
```

Also, there is a fast mode.

```
RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS=200 ./anna --fast
```
